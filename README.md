<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I was working in the office when I discovered a new idea. A game in which the program will generate a random number and in a specific time you need to find the random number out.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation Guide

1. At first you need to install git on your local computer. For that you need to go to this [website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Go to your windows explorer and search for a good place for storing this project
3. Now right click on your folder or place and then click on "Git Bash Here"
4. Finally you will see a new program. If you do you only have to enter this
   ```sh

   ```
